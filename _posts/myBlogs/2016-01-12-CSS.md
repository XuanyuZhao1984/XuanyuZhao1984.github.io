### CSS RWD

1, Grid view:
The columns inside a row are all floating to the left, and are therefore taken out of the flow of the page, and other elements will be placed as if the columns does not exist. To prevent this, we will add a style that clears the flow:

CSS:
.row:after {
    content: "";
    clear: both;
    display: block;
}

2, Always Design for Mobile First
