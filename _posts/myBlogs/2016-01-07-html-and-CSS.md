### HTML5
html specifies the content of the web site. It contains elements like this syntax:
"<start tag attributes>CONTENT</end tag>", elements could be nested.


### CSS
CSS specifies the style of the page. The syntax is : selector {property:value; ....} . Sector and declaration block.

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

1, An inline style(inside a html element) has the highest priority.
2, In html, use div elements to group many elements and apply css style to them only once.
3, margin: outside border, padding: between border and the content
