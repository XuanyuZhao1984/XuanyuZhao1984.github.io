Today I start to learn web development. My purpose is to master MEAN bundle stack and be a full stack developer. 


## 

### Github and Jekyll

First of all I registered a Github account and begin from this popular version-control tool. 
Issues means "to-do". Branch is a snapshot of master branch at a certain time. A branch is used to develop a new feature. Once that's done, developers usually create a pull request and merge the branch back to master branch. Then that branch could be deleted.
A fork is a copy of the whole project at a certain time. Some developers continue to work on this copy and never merge back to the original project. By this I mean, a fork begins a different project.

"Fork A Repo. A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea."
